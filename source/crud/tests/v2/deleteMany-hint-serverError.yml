  # These tests assert that the driver does not raise client-side errors and
  # instead relies on the server to raise an error. Server versions >= 4.1.10
  # raise errors for unknown deleteMany options, but the spec requires
  # client-side errors for < 4.2. Support for deleteMany hint was added in
  # 4.3.4 (SERVER-44367), so this test is run between versions 4.2.0 and
  # 4.3.3 (inclusive).
